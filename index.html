			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					Hi! As the title shows, you've reached the personal website of Ryan Eades. Thanks for stopping by! There's some fun stuff to see around here, and it continues to be updated every day. 
					Centered are some videos of various projects and activities I have been or am currently working on. Navigate to "Personal Activities/Personal Projects" for complete descriptions and Github links.

			<h3>Biography</h3>
				<div>
					I'm currently a student at Indiana University-Purdue University(IUPUI) studying pure mathematics and computer science. My main passion has always been learning,
					so I find myself engaging with many different departments(physics, engineering, philosophy) based on my current interests. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degrees with the intent to eventually obtain
					a Ph.D. in pure mathematics. I study computer science due to its abstract roots in formal mathematical logic. A main extracurricular activity of mine is philosophical 
					study, so the works of Turing, Church, Godel, Russell, Wiener, etc have been especially motivating in this respect. At the same time, I greatly enjoy building things,
					as evidenced in this site and my personal hobbies such as vehicle repair and computer hardware. From proofs of the most abstract mathematical concepts to rebuilding
					an ignition system, I am constantly pursuing new challenges and problems to ponder and conquer. I'm more than happy to do this on my own, but financial considerations
					motivate me to seek out like-minded individuals with similar passion and dedication. Please take a look at some of the work I've done and experiences I've had to find out
					if your current problem seems like one we could benefit from solving together. Thanks!
